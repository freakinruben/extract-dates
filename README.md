This is intended to extract possible date strings from a text stream 
and put the dates on standard out in an unambiguous format.

Currently it can extract the date strings pretty well,
and reformats them,
but the output is primitive and uncustomizable.

Note that whatever github says, 
there is not a shred of JavaScript in here.
It's all Ruby.
